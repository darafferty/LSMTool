def transfer(LSM, patchSkyModel, matchBy='name', radius=0.1):
    """
    Transfer patches from the input sky model.

    Sources matching those in patchSkyModel will be grouped into
    the patches defined in patchSkyModel. Sources that do not appear in
    patchSkyModel will be placed into separate patches (one per source).
    Patch positions are not transferred (as they may no longer be appropriate
    after transfer).

    Parameters
    ----------
    LSM : lsmtool.skymodel.SkyModel
        Input sky model
    patchSkyModel : str or lsmtool.skymodel.SkyModel
        Input sky model from which to transfer patches
    matchBy : str, optional
        Determines how matching sources are determined:
        - 'name' => matches are identified by name
        - 'position' => matches are identified by radius. Sources within the
            radius specified by the radius parameter are considered matches
    radius : float or str, optional
        Radius in degrees (if float) or 'value unit' (if str; e.g., '30 arcsec')
        for matching when matchBy='position'

    Examples
    --------
    Transfer patches from one sky model to another by matching to the source
    names and set their positions::

        >>> LSM = lsmtool.load('sky.model')
        >>> transfer(LSM, 'master_sky.model')
        >>> setPatchPositions(LSM, method='mid')

    Transfer patches by matching sources that lie within 10 arcsec of one
    another::

        >>> LSM = lsmtool.load('sky.model')
        >>> transfer(LSM, 'master_sky.model', matchBy='position', radius='10.0 arcsec')
        >>> setPatchPositions(LSM, method='mid')
